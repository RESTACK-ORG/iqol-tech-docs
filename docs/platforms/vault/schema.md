## 2. Page Structure and Workflow with Field Dependencies

### 2.1 User Level Pages

#### Intake Page
- **Purpose**: Initial entry point for leads and new users
- **Key Features and Field Dependencies**:
  - **Add Lead Functionality**:
    - Checks `phoneNumber` in User schema to determine if user exists
    - If user exists: Creates new Service for existing User and updates `serviceIds` array
    - If user doesn't exist: Creates new User and Service records
    - Sets `userSource` to track how lead was acquired

  - **Interest Field Effects**:
    - Changes to `userInterest` have critical effects:
      - Setting to "interested": Default state for active leads
      - Setting to "not interested": Moves service to closed bucket, sets `serviceStatus: 'closed'`
      - Setting to "pause": Opens modal to set `onHoldUntil` timestamp, sets `userInterest: 'on hold'`

  - **Filters**:
    - Interest: Filters by `userInterest` field
    - Acquisition POC: Filters by `acquisitionPOC` field
    - Sales POC: Filters by `salesPOC` field
    - Priority: Filters by services with `priority: true`
    - Service Stage: Filters by services with specific `serviceStage`
    - Escalated: Filters by `escalated: true`
    - Date: Filters by `added` timestamp

  - **Metrics Calculations**:
    - Total Leads: Count of all users
    - Escalated Leads: Count of users with `escalated: true`
    - Qualified: Count based on service `serviceStage: 'qualified'`
    - Total SRs: Sum of `numberOfServices` across all users
    - Priority SRs: Count of services with `priority: true`
    - Stale: Count of users with `added` timestamp older than 15 days

- **Key Transitions and Trigger Conditions**:
  - **Pre-active to Active**:
    - Triggered when any service for a user has:
      - `serviceStage: 'qualified'`
      - `serviceStatus: 'open'`
      - `docummentSubmissionStatus: true`
    - Effect: Service `bucket` changes to 'active', adds new entry to `bucketTransitions`

  - **Interest Status Change**:
    - Changing `userInterest` to "not interested":
      - Sets service `serviceStatus: 'closed'`
      - Updates `userInterest` in User record
      - Logs activity in User and Service `activity` arrays
    - Changing `userInterest` to "on hold":
      - Opens pause modal to set `onHoldUntil` timestamp
      - Updates `userInterest` in User record
      - Logs activity in User and Service `activity` arrays

### 2.2 Service Level Pages

     - Set pause duration, creating `pausedUntil` timestamp
     - Execute pause:
       - Update Service `serviceStatus: 'paused'`
       - Create `pauseMetadata` object with:
         - `pausedUntil` set to expiry timestamp
         - `pausedBy` set to current agent
       - Decrement User `activeSr`
       - Increment User `pausedSr`
       - Log activity in Service `activity` array

   - **Dependency Pause**:
     - Open Pause modal with dependency option
     - Set pause duration and dependent service
     - Execute pause:
       - Same as regular pause, plus:
       - Set `pauseMetadata.dueToDependency: true`
       - Set `pauseMetadata.dependencyServiceId` to selected service
       - Increment User `dependencySr`
       - Optionally create follow-up service to track dependency
       - Log activity in Service `activity` array

   - **Unpause Process**:
     - When `pausedUntil` timestamp passes or manual unpause:
       - Update Service `serviceStatus: 'open'`
       - Clear `pauseMetadata` object
       - Increment User `activeSr`
       - Decrement User `pausedSr`
       - If dependency pause, decrement User `dependencySr`
       - Log activity in Service `activity` array

2. **Blocking a Service** (Active Page to Blocked Page):
   - **Move to Block Action**:
     - Open Block modal
     - Set `blockerReason` from predefined list or custom entry
     - Assign `blockerPOC` responsible for resolution
     - Execute transition:
       - Update Service `bucket: 'blocked'`

         - If `bucket: 'blocked'`: Decrement User `blockedSr`
       - Increment User `lostSr`
       - Log activity in Service `activity` array

### 3.3 Activity Tracking System

- **Cloud Function Triggers**:
  - Listens to changes in Service collection
  - Listens to changes in User collection
  - Listens to changes in Payment collection

- **For Service Changes**:
  - Captures before and after states
  - Creates Activity record with:
    - `time` set to current timestamp
    - `user` set to current agent
    - `action` describing the change type
    - `target` set to affected field or entity
    - `from` capturing previous value
    - `to` capturing new value
    - `serviceId` linking to affected service
  - Appends Activity to Service `activity` array

- **For User Changes**:
  - Similar to Service changes
  - Captures user-level field changes
  - Appends Activity to User `activity` array

- **For Payment Changes**:
  - Captures payment creation, updates, deletions
  - Links Activity to both Service and User

- **Activity Viewing**:
  - Activity tab in Service Details Panel shows chronological history
  - Filters allow focusing on specific activity types
  - Each entry shows:
    - Timestamp
    - Agent who made the change
    - Field that changed
    - Previous and new values
    - Any notes or context

## 4. Advanced Workflow Considerations and Edge Cases

### 4.1 Document Submission Rules

- **Pre-Active Stage**:
  - Cannot mark documents as submitted if `serviceStage: 'unqualified'`
  - Document submission is a prerequisite for moving to active

- **Active Stage Document Handling**:
  - Doc stage involves validation of submitted documents
  - If documents found incomplete during validation, service can move back in substage

### 4.2 Service Stage and SubStage Progression

- **Normal Progression Path**:
  ```
  Pre-Active:
  - Unqualified -> Qualified
  
  Active:
  - Doc: To Validate -> Incomplete -> Verified
  - Filing: In Queue -> In Process -> Submitted
  - Awaiting: Awaiting -> (Re-Apply) -> Approved
  - Correction: Verifying -> (To Correct) -> (Cancelled) -> Completed
  - To Close: Doc Shared -> Invoiced -> Paid
  ```

- **Special Transitions**:
  - `subStage: 'Re-Apply'` moves back to Filing stage
  - `subStage: 'Blocked'` moves to blocked bucket
  - `subStage: 'Cancelled'` may lead to closing or marking as lost

### 4.3 Synchronization Functions

- **Service Status Updates**:
  - When `serviceStatus` changes:
    - Function `updateServiceStatusAndSyncCounts` triggers
    - Updates corresponding counters in User record
    - Ensures User and Service stay in sync

- **Service Stage Updates**:
  - When `serviceStage` changes:
    - Function `updateServiceStageAndSyncCounts` triggers
    - Updates `qualifiedCount` and `unqualifiedCount` in User record
    - Ensures User and Service stay in sync

- **Document Submission Updates**:
  - When `docummentSubmissionStatus` changes:
    - Updates `docSubmittedSr` in User record
    - Ensures User and Service stay in sync

- **Payment Updates**:
  - When payments are added or edited:
    - Updates `amountPaid` in Service record
    - Updates `totalPaidAmount` in User record
    - Ensures all financial fields stay in sync

### 4.4 Key Business Logic Requirements

- **Qualification Logic**:
  - Lead must be qualified before moving to active
  - Qualification requires initial contact and assessment

- **Document Submission Logic**:
  - Documents must be submitted before moving to active
  - Document status can be toggled only if service is qualified

- **Bucket Transition Logic**:
  - Every bucket change must update `bucketTransitions` array
  - Every bucket change must update corresponding counters in User record
  - Bucket entry time is used to calculate "Bucket Age"

- **Stage Advancement Logic**:
  - Final substage of each stage triggers advancement to next stage
  - Cannot skip stages in normal workflow
  - Special substages can trigger specific transitions

- **Activity Logging Logic**:
  - All significant changes must be logged in `activity` array
  - Activity entries must capture who, what, when, and how of each change
  - Activity logs are critical for audit and debugging

## 5. Common Bugfix Scenarios

### 5.1 User Counter Sync Issues

**Problem**: User counters (e.g., `activeSr`, `preActiveSr`) don't match actual service counts.

**Fix Approach**:
1. Verify all Service records for the User with mismatched counters
2. Count services in each bucket and status
3. Update User record with correct counts
4. Check for missing sync function calls in relevant service update methods

### 5.2 Bucket Transition History Gaps

**Problem**: `bucketTransitions` array missing entries or has incorrect timestamps.

**Fix Approach**:
1. Review Service `activity` array to find actual transition times
2. Reconstruct missing `bucketTransitions` entries
3. Ensure all bucket change functions properly update this array
4. Add validation to prevent future bucket changes without transition recording

### 5.3 Stage/SubStage Inconsistencies

**Problem**: Service has incompatible `serviceStage` and `subStage` values.

**Fix Approach**:
1. Identify correct stage based on service history
2. Set appropriate substage for the current stage
3. Verify that stage change functions properly reset substage
4. Add validation to prevent incompatible stage/substage combinations

### 5.4 Pause Metadata Corruption

**Problem**: Service is paused but has incomplete or inconsistent `pauseMetadata`.

**Fix Approach**:
1. Check if service is actually paused (`serviceStatus: 'paused'`)
2. Verify `pauseMetadata` has required fields:
   - `pausedUntil` timestamp
   - `pausedBy` agent reference
3. For dependency pauses, verify:
   - `dueToDependency: true`
   - Valid `dependencyServiceId`
4. Fix missing fields or reset pause status if metadata cannot be recovered

### 5.5 Activity Tracking Gaps

**Problem**: `activity` array missing entries for known changes.

**Fix Approach**:
1. Identify missing activities through timestamp analysis
2. Recreate missing activity entries based on known changes
3. Verify cloud function triggers are working properly
4. Add redundancy in critical update functions to ensure activity logging
